# Grundlagen Datenvisualisierung

## LE1 - Visualization basics, chart types
There are dozens of different visualization types. 
Do you want to show location, comparisons, change over time, distribution, proportions, hierarchy, other? 
You can see a catalogue here for inspiration, it is not a complete catalogue but good starting point 
and it includes a classification based on function. Check the annotated media library under the tab 
"Lernmaterial" for additional information to guide you. You will learn about the different types of 
visualizations (line, bar, pie, boxplot, map, bubble chart, parallel coordinates plot, etc. …), 
and importantly, when it is good to use which one based on considerations of visual variables, perceptual 
theories and empirical evidence. At the end of this, you should be able to select an appropriate 
visualization type based on the question that needs to be answered. Keep in mind that it is also 
important to optimize visualizations remembering user characteristics (expert analyst in a scientific 
organization vs. one time user of data journalism product, older user groups that might benefit from 
larger fonts vs. younger, children vs. adults …). Some of these considerations are included in LO2 Visual 
perception, and further highlighted in LO5 Evaluation.

## LE2 - Visual perception
Our perceptual abilities in discriminating visual features have evolved since the beginning of the human 
existence, and act in peculiar ways sometimes, e.g., as expressed in optical illusions (remember the dress?). 
It is important to understand what humans can discriminate in constant, stable ways, so that our 
visualization design respects human limitations and takes advantage of its strengths. Breaking perceptual 
phenomena into fundamental variables that are in every visualization helps with practical decision making. 
With this learning objective, you understand principles of applying perception for design, and the strengths 
and weaknesses of different visual variables (or channels) such as Bertin’s original seven variables 
(size, shape, lightness / value, orientation, texture, location, hue, saturation / intensity and arrangement) 
as well as some basics of Gestalt theory in relation to understanding perception for design, such as 
figure-ground, proximity, closure and common faith. "Lernmaterial" contains a media library to guide you, 
and you are of course always welcome to our office hours where we can examine some of the materials together.
